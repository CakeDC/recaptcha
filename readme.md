# Recaptcha Plugin for CakePHP #

Version 2.1 for CakePHP 2.x

The Recaptcha plugin for CakePHP provides spam protection in an easy use helper.

## Usage ##

To use the recaptcha plugin its required to include the following two lines in your `/app/Config/bootstrap.php` file.

	Configure::write('Recaptcha.publicKey', 'your-public-api-key');
	Configure::write('Recaptcha.privateKey', 'your-private-api-key');

Don't forget to replace the placeholder text with your actual keys!

Keys can be obtained for free from the [Recaptcha website](http://www.google.com/recaptcha).

Controllers that will be using recaptcha require the Recaptcha Component to be included. Through inclusion of the component, the helper is automatically made available to your views.

In the view simply call the helpers `display()` method to render the recaptcha input:

	echo $this->Recaptcha->display();

You could select another theme, setup it as parameter, for istance:

	echo $this->Recaptcha->display(array('recaptchaOptions'=>array('theme' => 'blackglass')));

For the complete list of themes, take a look here: [http://code.google.com/intl/it-IT/apis/recaptcha/docs/customization.html](http://code.google.com/intl/it-IT/apis/recaptcha/docs/customization.html).

To check the result simply do something like this in your controller:

	if ($this->request->is('post')) {
		if ($this->Recaptcha->verify()) {
			// do something, save you data, login, whatever
		} else {
			// display the raw API error
			$this->Session->setFlash($this->Recaptcha->error);
		}
	}
